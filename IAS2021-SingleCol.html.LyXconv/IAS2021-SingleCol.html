energy projects in the USA. Projects with main power transformers (MPTs)
equipped with either on-load tap changers (OLTC) or de-energized tap changers

<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >Independent system operators (ISOs) and transmission system operators (TSOs)
require any solar, wind or battery energy storage project to perform a reactive
power study before interconnecting to the transmission grid. This is due to the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order no. 827 FERC&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XFERC827">3</a>]. FERC
order no. 827 mandates that all non-synchronous generation projects meet
the 0.95 power factor (PF) requirement at the high side of the generator
substation, unless ISOs and TSOs establish a different PF range. The voltage
range of this PF requirement is set by the individual ISO and TSO and is
generally from 1.05 per unit voltage (Vpu) to 0.95 Vpu. The PF has to be
dynamic.
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >   The dynamic piece of the PF requirement is interpreted in most areas of the
USA as two sub-requirements that must be met simultaneously: the first is a 0.95
PF sub-requirement at the inverter or turbine low voltage terminals, the
second is a 0.95 PF sub-requirement to be met at the high side of the
generator substation. The 0.95 PF requirement at the low side terminals of
the inverter or the turbine means that the MVA nameplate rating of the
equipment cannot be used solely for active power (MW) injection, but
some of that MVA has to be reserved for reactive power (MVAr). The
0.95 PF requirement at the high side of the generator substation can be
met with switched shunts, capacitor or reactor banks, since some of the
MVAr at the inverter or turbine low side terminals gets lost throughout
collection.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   Any generator substation has one or more main power transformers (MPTs).
These MPTs step up the collection system voltage, typically 34.5 kV to the
transmission system voltage, typically 138 kV or higher. The inverter or turbine
transformers step up the inverter or turbine low side voltage, typically at 0.63-0.72
kV to the collection system voltage.
<!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >   Some areas in the USA interpret the second 0.95 PF sub-requirement as being
measured at the low side of the MPTs instead of the high side of the MPTs.
Some other areas, notably ERCOT in Texas, interpret the second 0.95 PF
sub-requirement as being measured at the Point of Interconnection (POI)
as they include a tie-line from the MPT(s) to the transmission grid in
the project. Lastly, it should be noted that the exact PF requirement,
voltage range, and point of measurement are listed in the interconnection
agreement (IA) of any project. In the following, it will be assumed that the PF
requirement is being measured at the high side of the MPT for a voltage
range of 1.05 Vpu to 0.95 Vpu. As will be seen later, this does not make
                                                                          

                                                                          
any difference and any other PF requirement variation can be studied
similarly.
<!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >   The purpose of any reactive power study is to ensure that the PF requirement
is met. This entails the following:

      are required since it is not economical to use a substantial portion of the
      MVA rating of the turbine or the inverter for dynamic reactive power
      support. On the other hand, reactor banks are sometimes required when

<!--l. 147--><p class="noindent" >Positive sequence data for all project components is required. Majority of
collection system is underground and thus cable resistance, reactance, and cable
charging capacitance is required. Cables are laid in the ground either in trefoil
or flat formation. The cable impedance used should correspond to the
formation used. Trefoil configuration has slightly more reactance than flat
formation due to the close proximity of the cable conductors. Thus, trefoil
configuration produces a bigger capacitor and reactor bank size, if one is
required since more cable reactance means more dynamic MVAr loss across
collection system. Underground cables connecting the individual wind
turbine transformers (WTTs) or inverter step-up transformers (ISU) are
modeled as pi-equivalent segments. Typical cable data is given in the
<a 
href="#x1-90007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: Appendix --></a>.
<!--l. 160--><p class="indent" >   Transformer positive sequence impedance is needed along with no load
losses. This is applicable to MPTs, ISUs, and WTTs. Most of the time, the
project is designed before transformer test reports are available. Worst case
transformer allowance should be used. It is typical that ISUs and WTTs
deviate from their bid data by as much as 7.5% per the IEEE standard
C57.12.90-2015[<a 
href="#XIEEEc5790">2015</a>]. This seems to be due to the relatively small MVA size of
these transformers. On the other hand, MPT test report impedance deviates
slightly from design data. It is safe to assume that the MPT impedance is
within 1% of the design data. Being too conservative with MPT impedance
can cause substantial MVAr loss across the MPT and leads to a very
conservative capacitor or reactor bank size. This is due to the substantially
large MPT impedance compared to the WTTs and ISUs. Most MPTs in
renewable projects are three winding transformers with the tertiary winding
connected in delta and not connected to any external load. Thus, modeling
the tertiary winding is not required since no-load losses only flows in it
which is small compared to the overall losses across the MPT. Typical
transformer data is given in the <a 
href="#x1-90007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: Appendix --></a>. Also, turbine downtower cables should be
modeled since they can cause substantial MVAr loss for the latest tall
turbines.
<!--l. 181--><p class="indent" >   Transformer tap changer should be modeled as designed. MPT tap changer,
whether OLTC or DETC, is installed on the high side winding while controlling
the low side winding. The same goes for the WTTs and ISUs. OLTCs typically
have thirty-three (33) tap positions, one of which is the neutral position. These
tap positions correspond to 1.1 Vpu to 0.9 Vpu in a step size of 0.00625 Vpu. On
the other hand, DETCs typically have five tap positions: two up, two down, and
one neutral position. These correspond to 1.05 Vpu to 0.95 Vpu in a step size of
                                                                          

                                                                          
0.025 Vpu.
<!--l. 191--><p class="indent" >   The tie-line positive sequence impedance must be included in the project
if the tie-line is of substantial length. This becomes critical if the PF
requirement is at the POI rather than at the high side of the MPT. A lot
of renewable projects are connected to the POI through a short slack
span and it is negligible in this case. Typical tie-line data is given in the
<a 
href="#x1-90007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: Appendix --></a>.
<!--l. 198--><p class="indent" >   Lastly, inverter and turbine reactive power capability (P-Q curve) should be
modeled. Care should be exercised when modeling any P-Q voltage dependency
during simulations. It is typical that turbines and inverters have P-Q curves that
are voltage dependent. Typically, turbine and inverters provide more reactive
power as the voltage at their terminal rises to a certain point. When the voltage
exceeds or drops below certain voltage level, typically 1.1 Vpu and 0.9 Vpu, the
turbine or inverter capability becomes limited. It is thus important to control the
voltage at turbine terminals to rated voltage range to maximize turbine and
inverter MVAr contribution. Maximizing turbine and inverter MVAr contribution
is necessary to minimize the capacitor bank or reactor bank size. Voltage
control will be detailed in <a 
href="#x1-30003">3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:TapChanger --></a>. Two examples of turbine P-Q capability are
given in the <a 
href="#x1-90007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: Appendix --></a>. Two examples of inverter P-Q capability are given in the
<a 
href="#x1-90007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: Appendix --></a>.
<!--l. 213--><p class="indent" >   It is important to note two points at the P-Q curves of the turbines and
inverters: one at maximum active power output, and one at zero active power
output. The point at maximum active power output correlates closely the
capacitor bank size since the dynamic MVAr loss across collection is maximum. It
is rare that a renewable project needs a reactor bank at full power output to meet
the PF requirement. The reason for this will be shown in <a 
href="#x1-70005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:PQCapbiloty --></a>. The zero active power
output correlates with the reactor bank size. Some old technologies of turbines
and inverters have zero MVAr capability at zero active power output. This leads
to some charging MVAr at the POI due to cable charging current under no
wind or no solar irradiance conditions. Some IAs require that the project
offsets charging MVAr, and in this case a reactor bank is the cheapest
solution.

<!--l. 229--><p class="noindent" >This section discusses MPT and WTT (ISU in case of solar or storage projects),
                                                                          

                                                                          
tap changer setting selection. Transformer tap changer setting selection is heavily
influenced whether the project has an MPT equipped with OLTC or DETC. Both
are given in the subsections below. We will use the wind project data in the <a 
href="#x1-90007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: Appendix --></a> to
guide this discussion. The wind project in the <a 
href="#x1-90007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: Appendix --></a> has three MPTs. The project also
has two turbine types: one is a 4.2 MW turbine and the other one is a 2.0 MW
turbine.
<!--l. 238--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1.  </span> <a 
 id="x1-40003.1"></a>DETC</h4>
<!--l. 240--><p class="noindent" >In this section, it is assumed that the MPTs have DETCs instead of OLTCs.
Several power flow cases should be performed to determine the optimum DETC
tap settings of the MPTs and WTTs when the project is producing 100% output.
These power flow cases should correspond to various POI voltages. Optimum
DETC settings would allow the project to meet the PF requirement at the POI
for the widest possible voltage range. In this case, the ISO or TSO must
determine the maximum scheduled voltage. Assume this is 1.03 Vpu for
now.
<!--l. 249--><p class="indent" >   An iterative approach is used to reach optimum DETC settings. The iterative
approach utilizes various power flow cases until the optimum DETC setting is
reached. The first such case is a power flow case with all DETCs at the nominal
tap position (1 Vpu:1 Vpu turns ratio) while maintaining the 0.95 lagging PF
requirement at a POI of 1.04 Vpu. A target voltage of 1.04 Vpu is selected to
ensure that the PF requirement at the maximum scheduled voltage of 1.03 Vpu
can be met. To meet the 0.95 lagging PF at the POI, turbines are adjusted to
supply as much reactive power as possible without violating the following
constraints:
      <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The voltage at the 4.2 MW turbine terminals is kept within the range
      1.13 Vpu to 0.87 Vpu, per its reactive power capability.
      </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   2. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The voltage at the 2.0 MW turbine terminals is kept within the range
      1.1 Vpu to 0.9 Vpu, per its reactive power capability.
      </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   3. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The voltage on the 34.5 kV collection system is maintained in the range
      1.1  Vpu  to  0.9  Vpu.  Sometimes,  1.065  Vpu  needs  to  be  considered
                                                                          

                                                                          
      instead of 1.1 Vpu. The 1.065 Vpu corresponds to a 5% increase of the
      cable operating voltage per the IEEE standards. Most, if not all, 34.5
      kV cables are rated at 35 kV. Some cable vendors rate their cables at
      1.1 Vpu voltage which is assumed in this subsection. The effect of this
      maximum cable operating voltage will be discussed later in this section.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 273--><p class="noindent" >With the turbines set to produce maximum reactive power, the remaining reactive
power needed to meet the PF requirement is supplied by the capacitor banks.
Based on the results of this case, the voltage at the turbine terminals is inspected,
and the highest voltage at the collector system is 1.1166 Vpu while the
lowest voltage is 1.1639 Vpu. Based on the results of the first case, it
is evident that a means to bring the voltage throughout the collector
system down to 1.1 Vpu is needed. It is also clear that a reduction of
approximately 0.064 Vpu is needed. This reduction can be carried out in two
ways:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">The first one is by adjusting the DETC settings of the MPTs at 1.05
      (+2 tap) which effectively reduces the voltage by 0.05 pu throughout
      the collector system. The remaining voltage reduction is achieved by
      tapping the turbines with the highest voltage at 1.025 (+1 tap).
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The second one is by adjusting the DETC settings of the MPTs at
      1.025  (+1  tap).  The  remaining  0.039  pu  voltage  reduction  can  be
      obtained by tapping some turbine transformers. The turbines with the
      highest voltage (above 1.125 Vpu) are tapped at 1.05 (+2 tap). Once
      all voltages are below 1.125 Vpu, then the remaining turbines with
      terminal voltages above 1.1 are tapped at 1.025 (+1 tap).</li></ul>
<!--l. 294--><p class="noindent" >The main difference between these two options is that the first option affects a 0.05
Vpu voltage drop throughout the collector system, while the second option affects
a 0.05 Vpu voltage drop only at the turbines that have higher than 1.1
Vpu voltage at their terminals. Just because a reduction of 0.05 Vpu was
accomplished using the DETCs of the MPTs does not mean that no more
turbines will need to be tapped. An MPT DETC tap of 1.05 Vpu will cause
some loss of reactive power which will need to be compensated either by
more capacitor banks or more turbine reactive power. In either of the two
cases, this additional reactive power may cause the voltage to be above
                                                                          

                                                                          
the constraints outlined above in this section. This is explained in more
detailed below in terms of adjusting the MPT DETC settings at 1.025
Vpu.
<!--l. 307--><p class="indent" >   The turbines that will be affected in the second option of setting the DETCs
are the ones that have higher than 1.125 Vpu at their terminals after adjusting
the MPT DETC to 1.025. Thus, the MPTs will be tapped at 1.025 in the
second option, then a power flow solution will be used to determine what
turbines have higher than 1.125 Vpu at their terminals. The turbines that
have higher than 1.125 Vpu voltage at their terminals will be short listed
for WTT tapping. A turbine that is short listed to have its transformer
tapped does not necessarily mean that its transformer will be tapped, as
it could be the case that adjusting the tap of one turbine could affect
the voltage at a nearby turbine. This will depend on what will be done
next.
<!--l. 319--><p class="indent" >   The turbines that are short listed are sorted in a descending order such that
the turbine that has the highest overvoltage is tapped first. Optimum DETC
settings are reached by tapping the WTTs one at a time. This means that the
turbine that has the highest voltage is tapped first, the power flow is re-solved,
more capacitor banks are added to meet the 0.95 PF requirement, the power flow
is re-solved, and the process continues while observing the constraints above in
this subsection until there is no need to tap more WTTs and the PF is met at
the POI. The process is summarized in <a 
href="#x1-40041">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Iterative-Process-to --></a>. After the tap settings of all
DETCs are finalized, those tap settings are used for all power flow cases to

<!--l. 428--><p class="indent" >   From operational viewpoint, it is not recommended to set the MPT DETC at
the highest tap since the scheduled voltage may increase in the future. If this
happens, raising the DETC tap in the site is the easiest solution instead of
re-running the whole reactive power study.
<!--l. 433--><p class="indent" >   The main problem with wind projects that have MPTs equipped with
DETCs is the fact that collection system voltage control is ineffective. An
OLTC keeps the low side bus voltage at a scheduled value whenever the
POI voltage changes. But in case of a MPT DETC, changes in the POI
voltage propagate to the low side with no means to control them. For
this reason, all transformer tap settings are to be calculated based on
the highest POI voltage possible, since this corresponds to the highest
collection and turbine terminal voltage. For the same reason, the capacitor
bank size must be calculated based on the lowest POI voltage. This is
because the MVAr of capacitor bank is proportional to the square of the bus
voltage.
<!--l. 445--><p class="indent" >   Lastly, the maximum continuous cable voltage will play a role in determining
the MPT DETC. If the cables were to run at a maximum of 1.065 Vpu, then an
MPT DETC of 1.05 Vpu (+2 tap) would have been the only solution. Same
thing goes for the turbines. If the voltage at the turbine terminals were to
be limited to 1.1 Vpu, the 1.025 Vpu tap at the WTTs would not be
feasible.

<!--l. 454--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we consider that the project has the exact same data
as given in <a 
href="#x1-40003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:DETC --></a>, but assume that the MPTs are equipped with OLTCs
instead.
<!--l. 458--><p class="indent" >   Contrary to <a 
href="#x1-40003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:DETC --></a>, no iterative approach is needed. The turbines are dispatched
to maximize active and reactive power possible with the POI scheduled at 1.05
Vpu. Capacitor banks are then added to meet the PF requirement at the POI.
This is done while observing the same constraints given in <a 
href="#x1-40003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:DETC --></a>. In the current case,
and generally, the MPT OLTC solely can be used to bring down the voltage to
levels that maximize turbine MVAr contribution without regard to the POI
voltage. This is due to the large operation range of the OLTC which is <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">±</span><span 
class="cmr-12">10%</span>
compared to <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">±</span><span 
class="cmr-12">5% </span>in case of the DETC. In the current example, the capacitor
banks needed are 1.5 MVArs per bus. This is to be compared against the
6.5 MVAr obtained in <a 
href="#x1-40003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:DETC --></a>. The reason for this is that the voltage in the
                                                                          

                                                                          
collection system is now decoupled from the POI voltage since the OLTCs
have enough bandwidth to control the low side bus voltage to healthy
levels.
<!--l. 473--><p class="indent" >   When the turbine MVAr contribution is highly dependent on the turbine
terminal voltage, the OLTC can still be used to satisfy the voltage constraints.
However, adjustments of the DETC of WTTs will probably need to happen to
bring the voltage at turbine terminals to levels that can maximize turbine MVAr
contribution. In some other instances, such optimization is not possible due to the
length of the collection system.
